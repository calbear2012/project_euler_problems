    returns a sum of all ints below num (int) that are multiples of mult1 (int) or mult2 (int)
    Also keeps a list of all such numbers
    
    Application for Euler question 1: 
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
    The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
